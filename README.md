## Attributions
**Facebook Messenger Translation Bot** is an open source project built with skills learned at  [CoderSchool](http://http://www.coderschool.vn/)

### Technology
Facebook Messenger Translation Bot is built using **Ruby** as the scripting language and **Sinatra** for DSL. It links with the **Google Easy Translate API** to allow for a larger library of translatable languages to be available to the user.

### Description
The Bot will ask users what language preference they have for translation, what language they'd like the bot to translate **to**. Afterwards, users have the option of changing the language setting by entering the command

`language:language_choice`
EX:
> language:French
